Future updates will restrict deletions to only those courses created by the logged-in teacher.\n\n### Technical Notes\n\n- **Permissions and Authentications**: Implement role checks to ensure that teachers can only edit or delete their own courses in the future update.\n- **Database Interactions**: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations will be implemented for the course data in relation to the logged-in teacher's ID.\n\n### Development Steps\n\n1. **Setup a Database**: Configure tables for `Teachers` and `Courses` with relational links.\n2. **Develop the Backend**: Create APIs for handling login, course creation, editing, viewing, and deletion.\n3. **Build the Frontend**: Develop the UI using a framework like React or Vue.js for dynamic page interactions.\n4. **Implement Authentication**: Secure login mechanisms and session management to ensure secure and effective role handling.\n5. **Initial Deployment and Testing**: Deploy the system on a development server for testing the functionalities and user interface.\n\n### Future Enhancements\n\n- **Advanced Permissions**: After initial testing, refine the permissions so that teachers can only delete or edit their own courses.\n- **Audit Logs**: Implement logging to track who created, edited, or deleted courses for accountability.\n\n> Written with [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/
