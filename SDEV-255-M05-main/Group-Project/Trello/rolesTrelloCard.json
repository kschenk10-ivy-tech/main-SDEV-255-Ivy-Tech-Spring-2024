WE should also be prepared to handle aspects of project management and documentation collectively.\n\nHere are potential roles and responsibilities each of us for working on this project:\n\n### Student 1: Front-End Developer\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n1. **Interface Design:** Create and implement the visual design of the website, ensuring it is user-friendly and accessible.\n2. **Front-End Programming:** Develop the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript necessary to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.\n3. **Integration:** Work closely with the back-end to ensure that the front-end integrates smoothly with server-side processes and data handling.\n4. **Testing and Debugging:** Conduct thorough testing of the front-end functionalities and fix any bugs that arise.\n5. **Documentation:** Document the front-end design and development processes, including guidelines on how to use and modify the front-end code.\n\n### Student 2: Back-End Developer\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n1. **Server-Side Logic:** Develop the back-end logic using a suitable server-side language (like Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.) to manage data transactions and user authentication.\n2. **Database Management:** Design and implement a database to store, retrieve, update, and delete course and user data securely and efficiently.\n3. **API Development:** Build APIs for front-end to back-end communication, ensuring secure and efficient data exchange.\n4. **Security:** Implement security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access, especially concerning user authentication and course management.\n5. **Testing, Debugging, and Documentation:** Test the back-end functionalities, fix any issues, and document the back-end structure and API endpoints for easy management and further development.\n\n### Shared Responsibilities\n\n1. **Project Planning and Management:** Both students should participate in planning the project scope, deadlines, and milestones.\n2. **Collaboration and Communication:** Regular meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and feedback to ensure both sides of the application are aligned and integrated properly.\n3. **Testing and Quality Assurance:** Both should work together on final integration testing and debugging to ensure the application works seamlessly as a whole.\n4. **Documentation:** Jointly create comprehensive documentation that covers the entire system, its architecture, and usage instructions to ensure sustainability and scalability of the project.\n5. **Presentation:** Prepare to present the completed project to instructors or classmates, explaining the technology stack, the development process, and the functionalities of the system."},"board":{"id":"661c88ffae8eebf6d8a9e387","name":"Project Management","shortLink":"V7irDZve"},"list":{"id":"661e1cd3ac0e5d2b8e3d6f17","name":"Plans and Designs"}},"appCreator":null,"type":"updateCard","date":"2024-04-16T10:09:21.103Z","limits":null,"memberCreator":{"id":"661b762f446f715e7951c692","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"3a0bdc275376b0cb2fc2972b31fd0105","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/661b762f446f715e7951c692/3a0bdc275376b0cb2fc2972b31fd0105","fullName":"Khristin Schenk","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"KS","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Khristin Schenk","initials":"KS","avatarHash":null},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"khristinschenk1"}},{"id":"661e4c9ac2540e73e0cb898f","idMemberCreator":"661b762f446f715e7951c692","data":{"card":{"desc":"Given the scope of this project and the fact that only two students are involved, it's crucial that we both have a broad understanding of both front-end and back-end aspects to step in for each other as needed.
